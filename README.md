# LiPDbooks

A collection of Jupyter notebooks describing how to leverage the Linked Paleo Data (LiPD) ecosystem of digital resources to facilitate paleoclimate research. 

## The LiPD ecosystem

![LiPD ecosystem](“LiPD_ecosystem_v4.jpg”)


The LiPD ecosystem consists of the following resources:
- the LiPD data standard, described in [McKay & Emile-Geay (2016)](https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-12-1093-2016), which is [GeoCODES](https://www.earthcube.org/geocodes)-compliant. 
- The [LiPD utilities](https://nickmckay.github.io/LiPD-utilities/), a set of codes in Matlab, R and Python to interact with LiPD data.
- The LiPD [playground](http://lipd.net/playground), a user interface to get your data into LiPD.
- [GeoChronR](https://nickmckay.github.io/GeoChronR/), an R package to generate state-of-the-art age models using ensemble methods, analyze those ensembles with a number of commonly-used techniques, and visualize results in an intuitive way. 
- [Pyleoclim](https://github.com/LinkedEarth/Pyleoclim_util/), a Python package with many of the same capabilities, as well as other ones. 
- the [LinkedEarth Ontology](http://linked.earth/ontology/), a formal ontology describing the LiPD data model in human- and machine-readable form. 
- the [LinkedEarth platform](http://wiki.linked.earth), which has served as community hub to develop the first [PaleoClimate Reporting Standard (PaCTS)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019PA003632).

## Objective
LiPDBooks gathers multiple examples of complex workflows inspired by real-world paleoclimate problems. If you have suggestions for more examples, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/LinkedEarth/LiPDbooks/issues).

## Requirements

All code is open-source, with installation instructions provided with each package. Most of the code herein uses R or Python, both freely available. If you have issues installing any of it, please get in touch.
